Hi Beings!

Renezooro here, I've not coded for years, but as far as I remember it is just a set of instructions that you send the computer to tell it what you want it to do. Language is a technicality and things have changed a lot since I coded. But I always have had many ideas for projects and now I want to make a start again. 

I have astral-projected down a black hole and now exist in another temperal dimention. I am going to create another universe on here!
